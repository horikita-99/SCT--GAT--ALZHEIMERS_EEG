 ðŸ§  SCT-GAT: EEG-Based Alzheimer's and Dementia Classification Using Graph Attention Networks

This project implements a deep learning framework that combines advanced **time-frequency analysis (Synchrosqueezed Chirplet Transform)** with **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** to classify Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals using EEG data.

The model achieves high classification accuracy and enhances interpretability by modeling inter-channel EEG relationships as graphs and leveraging attention mechanisms.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- âœ… **SCT-Based Feature Extraction**: Captures subtle timeâ€“frequencyâ€“chirp changes in EEG signals, outperforming traditional spectral methods.
- âœ… **Dynamic Brain Graphs**: EEG signals are converted into graphs where each node represents a channel and edges reflect feature similarity.
- âœ… **Graph Attention Network (GAT)**: Learns to highlight the most relevant inter-channel relationships using attention mechanisms.
- âœ… **Binary and Multi-Class Classification**: Supports both AD vs CN and AD vs FTD vs CN classification tasks.
- âœ… **High Accuracy**:
  - AD vs CN: ~92%
  - AD vs FTD vs CN: ~83%
